 * The app's one IndexedDB database. Schema versions are declared here and only here.
 * Version 1 (M0) was empty; version 2 (M3) adds the log tables; version 3 (M4b) adds the gyms,
 * with no upgrade callback, so no version 2 row is rewritten (the home gym is written at launch by
 * `ensureLocations`); version 4 (M6) adds the Program screen's edits, one row per edited slot, keyed
 * by its id, again with no upgrade callback, so no version 3 row is rewritten; version 5 adds the exercises
 * Shawn adds to a session, one row each, again with no upgrade callback; version 6 (metrics phase 1)
 * adds nothing to the store: runs may carry an RPE and workouts a session RPE and minutes, all
 * optional and unindexed, and the bump keeps the backup's schema version in step with this one
 * (src/db/backup.test.ts). Never edit a shipped version; add the next one, and keep every change additive.
