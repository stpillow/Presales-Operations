 * What an activity from Strava becomes in the app (Shawn's Nov 6 ask; PROGRAM-QUESTIONS 142). Strava
 * can supply the day, distance, time and a perceived effort; it can never supply max pain, which the
 * reading needs and which only Shawn knows, so an activity is never saved on its own: it opens the run
 * logger filled in, and Save waits on the pain like any run, and on the effort when Strava has none
 * (it is never guessed: an unrated effort would read as a rated one in training load). Runs,
 * elliptical and rowing map onto the run logger; a strength activity points at "Log this session after the fact"; everything else is
 * left out with the reason. An activity already logged (its Strava link on a run) is not offered again.
